ClickUp Mini Project

This repo has all the answers for the text ClickUp mini project as dictated by me (B.Serrato). The original form of this project was located on [GoogleDocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RGsgLoLxRvdSsRmoyuqF635iG7nq8ulz46lvApw6b6U/edit#)  . Unfortunately, the project was locked due to security and copying reasons, but the text was still capable of being copied from the console with the command ```document.bodyinner.Text```. The explaination can be found from this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40296831/is-it-possible-to-force-a-copy-of-a-protected-google-doc) answer.
