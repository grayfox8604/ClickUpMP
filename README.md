ClickUp Mini Project

This repo has all the answers for the text ClickUp mini project as dictated by me (B.Serrato). The original form of this project was located on [GoogleDocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RGsgLoLxRvdSsRmoyuqF635iG7nq8ulz46lvApw6b6U/edit#)  . Unfortunately, the project was locked due to security and copying reasons, but the text was still capable of being copied from the console with the command ```document.bodyinner.Text```. The explaination can be found from this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40296831/is-it-possible-to-force-a-copy-of-a-protected-google-doc) answer.

In the document __2) Priority and Severity__, the second question is listed in normal markdown text. My responses are listed in the quoted, bulleted markdown text. Aside from priority and severity, I've also listed my reasoning. In the document __3) Response__, the third question is answered in the *My Adjustments* section. The corrections I did are bolded, followed by my reasoning for the change.
