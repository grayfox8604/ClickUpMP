## Original

Hey ClickUp Support!

My Space “Founding America" is saying that I don’t have 
access to it. I am the Owner of this space so it doesn’t
make sense why I am getting an ACCESS_015 error.
Originally, Brit Ishe owned that Space, but since she left
the company, the rights should’ve been given to me.

Can you hop on a Zoom video call and help me please?

Thanks,

Jorge Washingtin

Hey Brit Ishe!

Thanks for writing in.

Members receive the ACCESS_150 error when they don’t have the correct 
permissions to the Folder you’re trying to access. Since Brit Ishe was the last 
owner, he must have not transferred ownership to you before going on paternity
leave. Please see the documentation for this [issue here](https://docs.clickup.com/en/articles/4209472-how-to-use-clickup-for-students).

I’m happy to set up a phone call with you to discuss this further!

Thanks

 __Hello Jorge Washingtin__, *(Aside from the incorrect name, we should be more professional when communicating with customers)*
 
 __Thank you for reaching out to us about your situation.__ *(Continue the professionalism)*

 Members receive the __ACCESS_015__ *(incorrect error code)* error when they don’t have the correct 
 permissions to the __Space__ *(Jorge is asking for help to access a Space, not a folder)* they’re trying to access. Since Brit Ishe was the last 
 owner, __she__ *(Jorge stated that Brit is female)* must have not transferred ownership to you before __leaving the company__
 *(Jorge stated that Brit left the company, not paternity leave)*. Please see the documentation for this [__issue here__](https://docs.clickup.com/en/articles/3423962-changing-a-space-s-owner)
 *(The incorrect documentation was attached)*. __I can adjust ownership to your user once we have proof of Ms. Ishe's separation of the company.__ *(This line is added to provide an action
 to Jorge's request, given that ClickUp is shown proof she is no longer an employee.)*
 
 I’m happy to set up a __Zoom video__ call with you to discuss this further! *(Jorge asked for a Zoom call, not a phone call)*
